        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>As a business consulting firm, Tapper Light Solutions primarily offers digital services. Therefore, our return and refund policy is designed to ensure clarity, fairness, and transparency in our engagements.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-box">
        <h2>2. Service-Based Refunds</h2>
        <p>We do not offer refunds for services that have already been delivered or substantially initiated. Each engagement begins with strategic planning and resource allocation which are non-recoverable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-box">
        <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>You may cancel a consulting agreement before the agreed project start date and receive a full refund of any advance payment. Cancellations after the project begins may be subject to partial or no refund depending on the work completed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-box">
        <h2>4. Digital Products</h2>
        <p>If you purchase any downloadable or digital material (e.g., templates, reports), all sales are final. We do not offer returns for digital goods once they’ve been accessed or downloaded.</p>
